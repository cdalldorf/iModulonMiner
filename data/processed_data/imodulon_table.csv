38,cell_wall_2,,16,0.003107123,structural,maybe noise. I think it more likely is two iModulons mushed together

19,noise_4,,19,0.003879806,noise,it has some consistent amount of translation/transcriptional genes but there's spaced really randomly and there is pretty bad replicate agreement about its activity so I'm saying noise
0,noise_5,,130,0.003823652,noise,
7,nucleotides_1,,5,0.007508505,metabolism,has a few post-translation modifiers which seem to be a lot of these iModulons maybe something to do with heat tolerance except they aren't that active in the heat samples

It looks like real noise though but I suppose a chromosome's noise could be on its own? I first would want to check how highly correlated the plasmid's genes are with each other before looking too much into this
