nucleotides_1,,5,0.007508504997991494,metabolism,has a few post-translation modifiers which seem to be a lot of these iModulons maybe something to do with heat tolerance except they aren't that active in the heat samples

It looks like real noise though but I suppose a chromosome's noise could be on its own? I first would want to check how highly correlated the plasmid's genes are with each other before looking too much into this
